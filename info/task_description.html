The child of your nearby friends has started to learn math not long ago. 
Now he is learning a simple math operations as addition and subtraction. But soon he will start to learn more complex themes: multiplication, division, powers and roots.<br>
You want to help him so your task is to create a two calculators - SimpleCalc() Ð¸ ComplexCalc(). The simple one will use only 2 operations - addition and subtraction with methods add(*args) and sub(x, y).<br>
<strong>add</strong>(*args) - count the sum of the all arguments.<br>
<strong>sub</strong>(x, y) - count (x - y).<br>
The complex one will be the decorator of the simple and will add additional methods/operations:<br>
<br>
<strong>multi</strong>(*args) - count the product of the all arguments.<br>
<strong>div</strong>(x, y) - count x/y.<br>
<strong>power(x, y)</strong> - count x in the power of y.<br>
<strong>root</strong>(x, y) - count root of degree y from x.<br>
<br>
If the result is an integer number - return it as int() type.<br>
Round all float results to the 5 decimal digits.<br>
In this mission you should use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern'>Decorator</a> design pattern.

<p>
<strong>Examples</strong>:
<pre class="brush: python">
calculator = SimpleCalculator()

calculator.add(9, 1, 5, 5, 0.2) == 20.2
calculator.sub(54, -16) == 70
    
calculator = ComplexCalculator(calculator)
    
calculator.multi(1, 3, 3, 9) == 81
calculator.div(3, 9) == 0.33333
calculator.power(2, 10) == 1024
calculator.root(81, 4) == 3
</pre>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>numbers and name of the math operation as the class method.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>the result of the operations.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    For work with math fuctions and objects.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    Real numbers.
